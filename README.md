A 50% accurate answer to the age-old question, "are we going to die to today?"

## How It Works

1. Fetch the most recent data that my Martian buddy has collected
2. Throw out the scientific mumbo-jumbo and keep the good stuff
3. Run the good stuff through a carefully calibrated, comprehensive, and scientific pipeline:
   - Is there a potentially hazardous asteroid approaching Earth?
     - If so, is it big and fast?
       - If so, "Yes".
   - Otherwise, "No"

## Disclaimer

Since this is the Internet, I have to say this...

- This is a joke website, do not take any of this seriously.

- This will not predict whether or not we are going to die.

- A potentially hazardous asteroid does not imply death or injury.

- I am not an expert of astronomical objects, astronomy, physics, or probability.

- I am just a random person that developed a silly website

- **Do not do something dangerous, stupid, or injurous to yourself, another being, or any property using this website as a reason/excuse.**
